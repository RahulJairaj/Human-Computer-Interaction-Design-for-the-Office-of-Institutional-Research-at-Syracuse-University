# Human Computer Interaction Design Project for the Office of Institutional Research at Syracuse University

OIRA is the office of institutional research and assessment at Syracuse University. For guidebook publishers to construct university rankings, they need access to University’s official channels to gather data. OIRA fulfills publishers’ data needs by supplying internal data collected from all departments across Syracuse University. The Guidebook system helps the OIRA staff to gather, manage, distribute and report the information. The goal of upgrading the existing system is to further enhance OIRA’s efficiency and effectiveness. The upgraded system should reduce the redundant and complex nature of sending out questionnaires to University personnel and then try to re-map their responses back to the original requests from the guidebook publishers. We followed an Agile lifecycle to gather requirements from the client throguh interviews, data profiling and business process walkthroughs. We performed our design and prototyping - both the high and low fidelity ones, iteratively, and received inputs form the clients and third party users to make the interface intuitive and user-friendly.
